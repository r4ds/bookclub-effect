# Designing Research

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe what a good research question entails
- Discuss research question types
- Explain why research needs a design
- Explain importance of a good research question


## Research Questions {-}

- Section 1.1, p.3-5
- A question that you plan to answer
- Contributes to improved understanding "how the world works"
 

1. Well-Defined
2. Answerable
3. Understandable

 
## Empirical Research {-}
- Section 1.2 p.4-5
- Any research that uses structured observations from the real world to attempt to answer questions.
- Quantitative empirical research uses quantitative measurements (numbers, usually). 
- Observations rather than reason
- More data sets, fewer interviews.
- Measurements hard to to collect precisely or interpret accurately
- Numbers we have donâ€™t actually answer the research question we have, what can we do?
- Goal is to collect the right data to answer the question and design reasearch to do this


## Why Research needs a design {-}

- Section 1.3 p.5-7 , 
- Capable of answering the question it's trying to answer
- Needed to evaluate first pass analysis and what to do instead
- Nutrition Research as example of lack of design
  1. Not having research capable to answer question
  2. Not actually answering the question
- Leads to inconsistent results which people cannot rely on nor use
- Could lead to too difficult a question to answer, but its still a takeway

## Book Goals {-}

To Improve Confidence in crafting a research project, what kind of data needed, and calculations to perform on data

-First Half:
1. Ways to build an answerable research question
2. Think of quantitative empirical research to perform to answer question

-Second Half:
1. "Toolbox" using observational data
2. Tools are widely applicable to answer many questions

## Discussion/Practicals {-}
Questions, Discussions, or Examples to fill in during Book Club Meeting
